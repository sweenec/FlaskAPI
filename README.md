# FlaskAPI
API created to practice Data Structures
Python Flask Framework

This is a basic Flask application using an SQLAlchemy database of users and blog posts.
I implemented various data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, binary search trees, stacks, and queues and applied them to various end points to practice their real-world use cases.

For example:
- Linked lists are used to get specific users or lists of users in ascending or descending order
- Hash tables are used to create blog posts
- A binary search tree is used to search for a specific blog post
- A queue is used to return the numeric sum of the equivalent ASCII values in the blog post bodies
- A stack is used to delete the last 5 blog posts from the database
